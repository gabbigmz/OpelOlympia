# Welcome!
 
Hello! This is my very first HTML website ever! Even though I have been studying the inicial steps of HTML, CSS & JavaScript for less than 4 weeks, I am extremely proud to show you the progress I've made so far. 

# Meet Ollie ;)

The intention of this website is mainly for myself, to keep record of the things I've learned. But also to share with you my love for Classic Cars. I believe all of them are gorgeous. However, Ollie holds a very special piece of my heart. 

# #CodingChallengeAccepted

As a new coder, I have decided to challenge myself and keep track of every achievement I make. With this website I tested my level of HTML and CSS only. But don't be surprised if you see a lot more websites coming soon.. 

# Comments & Suggestions

I believe that we never stop learning, no matter our age, experience or story behind. All comments and suggestions are always welcome in this profile. If you see anything that could be improved, please reach out!!!
